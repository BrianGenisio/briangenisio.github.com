If you are looking for the rest of my blog -- all the posts I have written over the years -- you'll have to look at my **["House of Bilz"](http://houseofbilz.com)** blog.  I recently moved over to using Jekyll as my site generator and I haven't gotten to translate all the old posts over.  I might get to it some day, I might not.  They are all there.
