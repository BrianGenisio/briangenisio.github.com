[We](http://LetsFixHealthcare.com) just got back from running the [NodeBots](http://nodebots.io) session [CodeMash](http://codemash.org) and I was blown away.  Not only did all of the bot builders exceed my expectations, my team rocked it as well.  We had an amazing event.  I've never seen so many nerds have as much fun as we did.

The event was held over two days with an open house on the third.  Tuesday had about 70 attendees and Wednesday saw over 90.  During the open house, well over 100 people came and went.  It was like a bee hive of creation -- builders buzzing from station to station, picking up their bits and bringing them back to their cell.

I can't come close to highlighting everything that happened those days, but I can showcase the stand-outs.

## Battle Bots
One of the two events attendees participated in was the "Battle Bots" event.  The only build rule: the drive train had to be powered by the two continuous rotation servos provided to them in their kits.  Other than that, it was a bot-build free-for-all.

The winner of the first day was [Julie Cameron](https://twitter.com/jewlofthelotus) and [Nate Dotz](https://twitter.com/nathandotz).  They built a scoop-style bot which transformed from a wedge to a bulldozer to a skid steer.  "Curb Feelerz" was agile and dangerous when it got its scoop underneath your bot.

By the second day, the attendees upped their game after being tipped off from the day before. The winner of the second day was [Charlie Sears](https://twitter.com/CharlieSears) and [Alex Matsukevich](https://twitter.com/fusionmobile/).  They learned that traction was a key factor for victory so they embedded thumb tacks in the tires.  Along with a low profile, a curved body, and plenty of heft, "WheelS of Death" crushed everything in its path.

These bots went head-to-head at the open house.  In the end, the spiked tires proved to be the advantage and "WheelS of Death" handily crushed "Curb Feelerz".

## Line Racers
Many of the pacifists in the group chose to avoid battle and hit the track.  Donned with a 6-sensor reflectance array, the line racers competed in time trials against a black-lined course.  There were several hairy turns and switchbacks they had to navigate, which proved difficult for some.  

![Awesome Bot](/images/codemash15/awesome-bot.jpg)

Day one produced the winner.  "Awesome Bot" was truly awesome with a 22 second finish without penalty.  [Andy Benz](https://twitter.com/andorbal) figured out that large Folgers-lid wheels had a huge advantage. The wheels needed some reinforcements and traction, but when that was done, "Awesome Bot" left the rest in the dust.

The second day was unable to show up the performance of "Awesome Bot", but it still gave a good show.  [Amber McKenzie](https://twitter.com/nlprunner/) and [Anthony Masi](https://twitter.com/snoopy_681/) figured out the wheel trick early on.  Instead of Folgers lids, they built their own wheels out of wood spokes, plastic rims, and tires made from cut-up rubber gloves.  "Bob" had so much traction that it was able to climb the walls and flip over!  In the end, they won the second day with a 25 second time trial.

## Best in Show
![Sherman](/images/codemash15/sherman.jpg)

If there was one bot which took the spirit of this event and ran with it, it would be "Sherman" by [Charlotte Chang](https://twitter.com/pushorpull) and [Christopher Greff](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=196107107).  They knew they wanted to use the tank treads, but they also knew that they needed to use the servos for power (which didn't fit in the tank chassis).  They found a gearbox, which also didn't fit in the chassis, and (literally) hacked it to bits to retro-fit the servos as power, and the tank wheels to the gearbox.  The result was pure hackery genius.  I LOVE this bot.

## Honorable Mention

It is also worth mentioning that someone brought a 3D printer to the hack lab.  We didn't know it was coming, but he gave access to anyone who wanted to use it.  Besides the owner, only one team took advantage of this tool.  [Jeanette Head](https://twitter.com/JeanetteHead17) and [Al Scott](https://twitter.com/aljscott/) had never 3D printed anything before, but that didn't stop them.  They found some gears on [Thingverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/) and geared up their servos for more power.  How awesome is that?  Here is a photo with them sporting their prizes (a [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) t-shirt, which everyone highlighted in this post also won, thanks to [Rick Waldron](https://twitter.com/rwaldron) and [Bocoup](https://twitter.com/bocoup))
