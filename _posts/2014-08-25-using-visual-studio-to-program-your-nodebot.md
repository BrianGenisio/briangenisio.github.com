Instead of using the [command line to manage your NodeBot workflow](/software/2014/08/25/bootstrapping-your-arduino-with-firmata-and-johnny-five.html), you may want to use Visual Studio in Windows.  This is certainly possible, using the Node Tools for Visual Studio.  Here is a screencast showing how to do that!
