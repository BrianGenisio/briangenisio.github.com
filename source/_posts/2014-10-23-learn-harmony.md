I've been working on a project lately for learning the next version of JavaScript.  It is called [LearnHarmony.org](http://learnharmony.org).  It allows for in-browser experimentation of next-generation JavaScript features.  I've created several micro-lessons on the features that are available and I will be adding more to come.

There are a couple of fun things regarding this:

 - The entire site is a static SPA, [built with ES6 features](https://github.com/BrianGenisio/learnharmony)
 - You can run ES6 features directly in the browser
 - I hijacked the console and display it on-screen to make play easier
 - This site was built with [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) and the REPL window also uses Traceur.

Have Fun!
