Last night (9/10/08), I had the pleasure of speaking at the [Ann Arbor .NET Developers Group](http://www.aadnd.org/). This was my first public talk in several years, and my first since switching my career focus from Linux to Windows. I had a great time, and I want to thank the group for giving me the opportunity to talk.   

As promised, I am posting the slides from my talk[ (PDF)](http://brianstestsite.googlepages.com/ActiveRecord.pdf). In addition, here are several links that I included in my talk:
