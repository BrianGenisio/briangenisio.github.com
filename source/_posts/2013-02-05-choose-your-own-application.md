It has been a while since I've posted.  I've been neck-deep in Single-Page Application work for the past year and haven't had much time to come up for air.  I wanted to show what my latest side project is.  [Choose Your Own Application](http://chooseyourownapplication.com) is a tutorial site for learning Single-Page Application stacks.  We help you build an application using your choice of technology.  You get to make choices as you go and you earn achievements as you try different things.  It is a ton of fun!

Dennis Burton and I worked on this with several other SRT colleagues and we are very proud of it.  We presented it as a half-day CodeMash session last month and the room was overflowing with over 100 participants, all heads-down and hacking out code. Since then, we've picked up another 300 or so users who have gone through the 22 different possible paths in the site.
