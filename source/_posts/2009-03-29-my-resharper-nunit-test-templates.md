Much like my previous post about what I use for testing in Silverlight, I was recently asked on Twitter for my ReSharper NUnit templates.&#160; I am posting them here if anyone finds them useful.

Basically, I write a LOT of tests every day.&#160; These templates allow me to write tests faster.

**New Test File Template**

This file template adds a new “Test” target when you say tell Visual Studio to create a new file from template.&#160; It populates your file with the correct namespaces and decorations to get you started.

**Coding Templates**

These are shortcuts that create new tests, setups, teardowns or assertions.&#160; You just type the shortcut, hit tab, and the method or lines are created for you with your mouse cursor in the next place to type.&#160; The shortcuts are:

*   test – Create a new [Test] method*   setup – Create a [SetUp] method*   teardown – Create a new [TearDown] method*   ise – Assert that condition is equal to value*   ist – Assert that condition is true*   isf – Assert that condition is false*   isn – Assert that condition is null*   isnn – Assert that condition is not null
