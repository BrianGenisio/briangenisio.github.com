This Friday, I will be presenting at [CodeMash](http://codemash.org) for the second year in a row.&#160; This year, my topic is [Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Flex * But Were Afraid to Ask](http://codemash.org/sessions#Everything+You+Always+Wanted+to+Know+About+Flex+*+But+Were+Afraid+to+Ask).&#160; It is really just a presentation form of my current series â€“ [Cross-Training in Silverlight and Flex](/archives/2010/10/24/cross-training-in-silverlight-vs-flex/).

As a good speaker-citizen, I wanted to post my slides and demo.&#160; They are available at BitBucket.org:
