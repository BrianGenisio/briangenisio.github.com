So at the [Ann Arbor .NET Developer's Group ](http://www.aadnd.org/)meeting the other night, I decided to give a 10 minute &quot;[lightning talk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk)&quot; version of my [Castle ActiveRecord ](http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html)talk. People seemed very interested in the concept and I will be giving a full-length talk on the topic on September 10th.   

Unfortunately, my company considers my first demo and presentation to be their [IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) and I can't use it for a public talk. Because of this, I need to come up with a new demo and a new PowerPoint stack. I suppose this is not the worst thing in the world, as it will force me to think about the holes and questions from my internal talk.   

My wife and I give each other alternating Fridays to get out of the house and do &quot;our thing&quot; while the other stays home while our child sleeps. So, I am at the coffee shop tonight, listening to music and playing more with ActiveRecord. I am thinking of a full-blown [Silverlight ](http://silverlight.net/default.aspx)application for recipe management as my demo.
