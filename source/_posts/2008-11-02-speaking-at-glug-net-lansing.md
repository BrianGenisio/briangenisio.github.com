I will be speaking at [GLUG.NET](javascript:void(0);/*1225681004271*/) Lansing on November 20th, 2008.&#160; My topic will be a talk I have given once before -- Castle Active Record (Don't Get Good at a CRUDy Job).&#160; Thanks to [Jeff McWherter](javascript:void(0);/*1225681105164*/) for signing me up for this gig.&#160; I look forward to meeting those in the Lansing area.
