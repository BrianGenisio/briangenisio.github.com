It seems everyone is publishing their goals for the year.&#160; I had some goals in my head, but I thought I would [mind map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindmap) them and publish them as well.&#160; I learned about this thought-organization technique at [Codemash](http://www.codemash.org/) and I really got a lot out of the exercise.&#160; My goals are broken down into four main categories: Health, Profession, Family and Enrichment.&#160; Many elements of these categories bleed into other categories, but here is my best attempt to unravel my mind-mapped goals for 2009.

**Health**

1.  Exercise
        1.  Swim 50 miles2.  Run occasionally3.  Lift weights often4.  Bicycle with Maia and Cara in the spring/summer/fall5.  Ride my bike to work at least 20 times2.  Food
        1.  Bake more bread2.  Eat less meat3.  Snack less at work3.  Loose 35 pounds  

**Profession**

1.  Learning
        1.  ASP.NET
            1.  MVC2.  jQuery2.  MEF3.  Ruby4.  F#5.  Pragmatic thinking2.  Community
        1.  Blog 50 times (professional or [personal](http://maia.genisio.org))2.  Speak publicly at least 5 times (conferences or user groups)3.  Get to know more people better  

**Family**

1.  Maia
        1.  Free swim and swimming lessons2.  Bike with her in the seat3.  More music (drums, guitar and CDs).&#160; Attend some live shows4.  More library trips5.  Read more2.  Cara
        1.  Reconnect2.  More dates3.  Show her I love her more4.  Read more3.  More visits with friends  

**Personal Enrichment**

1.  Less Television
        1.  Cancel cable2.  Watch less than 100 hours2.  Listen to more podcasts3.  Read more -- at least 10 non-technical books4.  Brew more beer5.  Learn guitar -- at least 50 chords6.  Join a sailing club7.  Write more (mostly in blog form)  

Wow... looking at this as an outline makes these goals seem extremely ambitious.&#160; Each individual goal is achievable, but the achieving aggregated list feels untenable.&#160; I suppose that when I look back on 2009, I will feel successful if I met about 2/3 of these goals.&#160;
