I put up another post to RiaRockstars.com recently.  This time it is about the [Presentation Model pattern](http://riarockstars.com/2011/03/16/presentation-model-and-multiple-screens-part-1/) and how it will aid you in developing for multiple screens (Phone, Tablet, Web, Desktop, etc).  It is part 1 of 2 in a series I am co-authoring with [Charlie Sears](http://www.srtsolutions.com/author/charliesears).
