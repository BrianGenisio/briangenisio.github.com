Last night, the [Ann Arbor .Net Developers](http://www.aadnd.org/) group held annual elections, and made new director appointments.&#160; The new leadership team is:     

<span style="font-weight: bold">President: </span>[Jay Harris](javascript:void(0);/*1234450632574*/)     
<span style="font-weight: bold">Vice President: </span>[Scott Zischerk](javascript:void(0);/*1234450693017*/)<span style="font-weight: bold">      
<span style="font-weight: bold">Secretary: </span></span>[Darrell Hawley](javascript:void(0);/*1234450722209*/)     
<span style="font-weight: bold">Treasurer: </span>Eric Bratton     

<span style="font-weight: bold">Director of Programming: </span>[Mike Woelmer](javascript:void(0);/*1234450740770*/)     
<span style="font-weight: bold">Director of Membership: </span>[Dennis Burton](javascript:void(0);/*1234450654547*/)     
<span style="font-weight: bold">Director of Sponsorship: </span>[Brian Genisio](javascript:void(0);/*1234450758584*/) (me!)     

With my new role, I will be soliciting companies for sponsorship.&#160; This will require me to get out there a bit more than I am used to, which is something that I have been pushing myself to do for about a year now.&#160; I am excited to be a more significant part of the group, as this group means a lot to me.&#160; I can't say that I know that I will be good in this role, but what the heck?&#160; Lets give it a try.     

Now, who wants to give me some money? :)&#160;&#160; <span style="font-weight: bold"></span>
