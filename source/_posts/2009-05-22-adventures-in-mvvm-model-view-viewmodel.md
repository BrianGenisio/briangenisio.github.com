This post is intended to be a high-level post intended to index all of my “Adventures in MVVM” posts.&#160; I will be traveling the region this summer giving talks on the MVVM pattern and these posts are part of me working through the details of the MVVM pattern.&#160; These posts will not include the “What”.&#160; There are [several](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd458800.aspx) [good](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx) [articles](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Continuum/MVVM/) on the [web](http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2008/11/08/learning-wpf-m-v-vm/) that do that already.&#160; Instead, I will be taking a deeper dive into MVVM and writing on the “How” and “Why” of the MVVM pattern.
