For those in the Ann Arbor, Michigan area, you might be familiar with the “[Come Jam With Us](http://www.comejamwithus.org/)” project.&#160; Every week, we get together for an hour and code on a particular topic.&#160; It is usually led by one or two people and the rest of the group codes along in order to learn about the topic at hand.&#160; It is a really great forum for learning new concepts and technologies.

This week, on Tuesday, March 2nd, I will be hosting an MVVM jam session at 5:30 ([directions](http://www.comejamwithus.org/where-you-can-find-us)).&#160; I will be taking you through the process of transforming a “Ball of Mud” application to use the MVVM architecture.&#160; We will do this in a test-driven way, so you can see the testability story of MVVM.

The prerequisites are very simple:

1\. Visual Studio 2008 or 2010 or [Visual Studio Express](http://www.microsoft.com/express/) (free)

2\. Download the [sample project](http://HouseOfBilz.net/MVVMJam/MVVM-Jam.ModelExtracted.zip).&#160; It is a rudimentary Twitter search application written with WPF.

3\. You should have some way of running NUnit tests from Visual Studio.&#160; If you have [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html) or [TestDriven.Net](http://testdriven.net/) (or any similar plug-in), then you are all set.&#160; ReSharper has a free 30 day trial and TestDriven.Net has a free version for personal use.

I hope to see you there!
