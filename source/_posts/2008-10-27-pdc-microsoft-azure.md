PDC has commenced. Herds of people flocked to the keynote where the topic was infrastructure. It may not be the most sexy of topics, but it is certainly the way that Microsoft is moving with their business plan. Specifically, they talked about their new cloud OS dubbed “Microsoft Azure”. Azure is going to be a scalable infrastructure for hosting cloud applications.   

One of the most interesting parts of this talk for me was the actual coding demo. They have included an embedded Azure simulator for debugging. It will let you develop your cloud app in your IDE without uploading it to their servers.   

Another important aspect of Azure is the ability to easily add more resources to your application. Whether it be ASP.NET or Silverlight, you will be able to run your app from their Azure cloud server and scale the resources as you see fit. Need to add resources for the Christmas season? No problem. In January, you can just reduce the resources assigned.   

Deployment is another important aspect of the Azure system. It is very easy to deploy your application to their servers via a single upload. Because I am here at PDC, I will have access to the Azure server today. I think I will go sign up now!
