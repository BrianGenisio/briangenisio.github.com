Just a quick note.  I will be popping over to [RIA Rockstars](http://riarockstars.com/) every once in a while to write content for them.  Essentially, they took over the hole that was left when Adobe and O'Reilly shut down [Inside RIA](http://insideria.com) last month.  Many of the same authors moved during that change, so the same quality of content should be expected of RIA Rockstars.

My first article, [Processing Data on the Client with ActionLinq](http://riarockstars.com/2011/02/07/processing-data-on-the-clientactionlinq/) is up.  I will try to cross-link any articles I write for them here.

Cheers,

Brian
