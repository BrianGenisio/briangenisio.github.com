I have been busy lining up opportunities to talk about Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) in the context of WPF and SIlverlight.&#160; The good news is that I have some great gigs lined up this summer:

*   June 11th, 2009 – [Greater Lansing .Net Users Group](http://www.glugnet.org/) – Flint, MI*   June 17th, 2009 – [Great Lakes Area .Net Users Group](http://www.migang.org/home.aspx) – Southfield, MI*   June 26/27, 2009 – [CodeStock](http://codestock.org/) – Knoxville, TN*   August 11th, 2009 – [West Michigan .Net Users Group](http://www.wmdotnet.org/) – Grand Rapids, MI (MVVM or Prism 2 TBD)  

In addition to that, I will be attending the [Ann Arbor Give Camp](http://michigangivecamp.org/cms/annarbor/) July 17-19.

In preparation for my MVVM talks, I will be honing my knowledge of the pattern by blogging here, so check back often if you are interested in MVVM!
