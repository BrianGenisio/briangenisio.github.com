Why am I doing this? Another blog? Another blog about software? Just another programmer who thinks that someone might care what he has to say? I don't know. I guess I am doing it to create more of an online presence... although if you &quot;google&quot; my name, you will find countless usenet conversations about everything from &quot;SSH Tunneling&quot; to blueberry jam. Searching for my alter-ego, Bilzmoude, will come up with a similar mish-mash of topics such as beer and MythTV. My presence is small, but it is there.   

So why a technical blog? Hasn't everyone already written everything I have to say? What is the point? Is this realling going to increase my &quot;web footprint&quot;?   

The point, I suppose, is to collect my thoughts about programming. I want it to capture what I am thinking in the moment. As my views change, I would like to be able to look back and see HOW they have changed. For instance, there was a time when I strongly believed that code without comments was bad code. I know believe the exact opposite. Likewise, I used to believe all functions should have a single exit point and have since changed my mind on that too. I know that I am growing as a developer because I am always changing my mind. As long as I am doing this, I know that I am still learning.   

I am also trying to learn to write better. Throughout high school and college, I took the common engineering attitude that writing wasn't my thing... programming was. I regret that attitude now that I am over 30 and my writing reads like a high-schooler. If I write more in my blog, will my writing get better? I hope so.   

There are several things I want to write about, though I can't promise how often I will actually write. I have had several blogs in the past (and I am currently maintaining a family blog with my wife) but historically, I have not written very frequently. If history is an indicator, this blog will be similar.
