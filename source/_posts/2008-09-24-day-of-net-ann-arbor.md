I got word this morning that I will be speaking at the [Ann Arbor Day of .NET.](http://www.dayofdotnet.org/AnnArbor/Fall2008/)   

I am excited about this since it is my first conference. I have given public seminars, and recently gave a talk at the [Ann Arbor .NET Users' Group](http://www.aadnd.org/), but this is my first conference.   

My talk will be about testing WinForms apps using NUnit. I have been developing my technique for testing WinForms GUIs for over a year now and I have learned a lot about the topic. It should be fun!   

This conference is free, so get registered soon!
