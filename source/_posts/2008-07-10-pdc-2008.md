I just signed up for [PDC ](http://microsoftpdc.com/Default.aspx)this year and reserved my airline ticket. I am excited to go to this, as it will be the highest profile development conference I have ever attended... by far. It will suck being away from my wife and 18 month old daughter for that long, but I think this conference will be a good thing for me.   

Before I started my .NET job 2.5 years ago, I only had 1 year of Windows development experience. Before that, it was all cross-platform, unix-like environments. Windows is still relatively new to me as a platform. Because of this, I certainly have never been to anything so [M$](http://www.microsoft.com) focused. I am going with a colleague from my office, so it should be a good time. If you are going, I will see you there!
