I am organizing a monthly lunch where local software developers from the Ann Arbor, MI area will get together to talk shop.&#160; It will be a very informal meeting where anyone is invited.&#160; We will meet on the third Thursday of every month, which means this month will be on December 18th at 12:00 PM.

If you are interested in the updates for this group, please subscribe to the Google Group: [http://tinyurl.com/AANerdLunch](http://tinyurl.com/AANerdLunch).&#160; 

For the first meeting, I will challenge you to bring a nerd with you!&#160;&#160; Bring someone who doesn't normally come to the community events, but is interested in being a part of the community if you can.&#160; Also, come with ideas about what you want this lunch to be.&#160; Do we want to keep it casual?&#160; Do we want to bring in &quot;special guests&quot; to help spur conversation?&#160; Do we want to keep it a software group?&#160; Or do we want to branch out to other nerds?&#160; What do YOU want in a nerd lunch?
