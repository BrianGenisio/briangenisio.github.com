[![CodeMash](https://www.codemash.org/images/bloggerbadge2008.gif)](javascript:void(0);/*1226945716395*/) It is official.&#160; I have registered for CodeMash '09.&#160; I have been told that this is the single-most important conference to go to.&#160; Many people have told me this.&#160; I have also been told that all the cool kids will be there.&#160; In fact, almost everyone I know in the community is planning to go...I HAVE to see what all the hype is about.   

The neat thing about this conference is how focused it is on being unfocused.&#160; There are a ton of languages and platforms being talked about... lots of hands-on labs... Open Spaces, etc.&#160; Anything goes.&#160; It seems really interesting, actually.   

So I am hitting this conference on my own dime.&#160; I am taking 3 days off work and heading down to Sandusky, Ohio in early January&#160; (7-9) for this nerdfest.&#160; 

The only question I have now, is... Are YOU going?
