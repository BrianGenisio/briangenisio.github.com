So, I just gave my GUI Testing in .NET talk for the first time. I think it went pretty well. If you have any feedback, please feel free to comment or email me. I'd love to hear how to make the talk better.   

I am providing the demo code and the talk slides. I have a few more posts on GUI Testing .NET apps that I wrote over the past few weeks. Please feel free to read what I have to say!
