I love Blogger. I have been using it for about 2 years in my [personal blog](http://maia.genisio.org/) and it has done me really well. When I decided to start up a tech blog, I figured that Blogger would work great for that as well. Unfortunately, in my last two posts, I had a bear of a time getting my code to format. Once I thought I had it, Blogger would re-format my code enough that my formatting got all screwed up again.   

I had gotten so frustrated, I was almost ready to switch blog software all together. Then I came across this Google Code project called [SyntaxHighlighter](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/). It is the tool I am using to make the source code on my blog look all pretty and shiny. It took me a bit of work to get it all set up, but [this blog post](http://yacoding.blogspot.com/2008/05/how-to-add-syntax-highlight-to-blogger.html) helped me along.   

Now, I can't say that I LOVE the usage here... I still need to bust into HTML in order to add a &lt;pre name=&quot;code&quot; class=&quot;c-sharp&quot;&gt; block, but it is a heck of a lot easier than what I had before. Thank you SyntaxHighlighter, you saved my day.
