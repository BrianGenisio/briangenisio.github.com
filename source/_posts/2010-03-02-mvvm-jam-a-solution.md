Thanks to all who came to the MVVM jam tonight.&#160; In case you wanted to see what a completed solution looks like, you can download it [here](http://houseofbilz.net/MVVMJam/MVVM-Jam-Complete.zip).&#160; There are many tweaks that can be made, and it is certainly not the only solution… but hopefully, it helps to understand how the MVVM pattern can be applied.

Next week (Wednesday, March 9th) , I will be giving a presentation on [Prism](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/) for Silverlight and WPF at the [Ann Arbor .Net Users’ Group](http://aadnd.org/).&#160; It is an eyes-forward talk about more patterns similar to MVVM.
