Four years ago, I moved to Ann Arbor to work with a talented team on what I consider to be an important, high-quality medical application.&#160; In that time, I had many great opportunities and I learned a ton from my colleagues.&#160; My team is filled with some really smart people!&#160; Because of this, I have mixed feelings to announce that I am moving on.&#160; Starting in February, I will be working for [Bill Wagner](http://thebillwagner.com/Blog) and [Dianne Marsh](http://diannemarsh.com/) and joining the team at [SRT Solutions](http://srtsolutions.com/).&#160; It will be quite a change for me -- moving from one of the largest companies in the world to a small, local consulting company.&#160; This job will, however, give me an opportunity to spend more time focusing on the technologies and concepts that most interest me.&#160; I am excited for this change, and I am excited to be working directly with the many amazing members of the SRT team.
